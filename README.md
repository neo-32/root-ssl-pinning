🔓 SSL Pinning Bypass on Rooted Android Pixel (2025 Guide)

This guide walks through bypassing SSL pinning on Android Pixel phones using modern methods like Magisk + Zygisk + LSPosed + TrustMeAlready or Frida.

📅 Updated for Android 13/14, Pixel 6-8, Magisk v27+, Zygisk-based setups.

📌 Prerequisites

✅ Rooted Pixel device

✅ Magisk installed (Zygisk enabled)

✅ Magisk App (latest version)

✅ ADB and USB debugging enabled

✅ Optional: Burp Suite or mitmproxy for HTTPS inspection

🔧 Method 1: LSPosed + TrustMeAlready (Zygisk)

🧱 Step 1: Install Magisk and Enable Zygisk

Install Magisk and reboot

Open Magisk → Settings → Enable:

Zygisk ✅

Enforce DenyList ✅

Reboot

🧩 Step 2: Install LSPosed (Zygisk version)

Download LSPosed Zygisk module from: https://github.com/LSPosed/LSPosed/releases

Flash the .zip via Magisk → Modules → Install from storage

Reboot

🛡️ Step 3: Install TrustMeAlready Module

Open LSPosed app (will appear after reboot)

Tap Modules → Search and install:

TrustMeAlreadyGitHub: https://github.com/ViRb3/TrustMeAlready

Enable the module for the target app (e.g., com.example.app)

Reboot

🧪 Step 4: Test the App with Burp

Install Burp’s certificate on Android as System CA:

Convert Burp .crt to .pem then to .cer

Place under /system/etc/security/cacerts/

Set permissions: chmod 644 and chown root:root

Use Burp Suite and configure Android proxy (manual or via Wi-Fi settings)

Open the app — if pinning is bypassed, you’ll see decrypted HTTPS traffic in Burp.

🔍 Method 2: Frida + Objection (Dynamic Hooking)

🧰 Step 1: Install Frida Server on Device

adb push frida-server-16.1.4-android-arm64 /data/local/tmp/
adb shell "chmod 755 /data/local/tmp/frida-server"
adb shell "/data/local/tmp/frida-server &"

📌 Ensure you're using the correct frida-server version for your architecture.

🐍 Step 2: Install Objection on Host Machine

pip install objection

🎯 Step 3: Launch Target App with Objection

objection -g com.example.app explore

Once inside the console:

android sslpinning disable

You can also run Frida manually with SSL unpinning scripts:

frida -U -n com.example.app -l android-ssl-pinning-bypass.js

🧬 Bonus: Patch APK Manually (Optional)

Use apktool to decompile the APK:

apktool d target.apk

Search for and modify checkServerTrusted, verify, or okhttp3.CertificatePinner logic in smali or Java

Rebuild:

apktool b target

Sign with apksigner:

apksigner sign --key yourkey.pk8 --cert yourcert.pem dist/target.apk

⚠️ Notes and Warnings

Some apps use native code or encrypted logic → Frida may be required

Some apps detect root or tampering → Use Shamiko to hide root

Always test in a legal and authorized environment
